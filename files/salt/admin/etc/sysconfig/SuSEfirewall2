#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note that running a packet filter/firewall is no panacea against
# network security threats. Make sure to
#
# - expose only actually needed services
# - assign different zones to express different levels of trust.
#   Opening ports for LAN services in the external zone defeats the
#   purpose of the firewall!
# - use software that is designed with security in mind (such as
#   postfix, vsftpd, openssh)
# - install security updates regularly

#
# Configuration Hints:
#
# Note that while this file looks like a shell script and is parsed
# by a shell script it actually is not a shell script itself. More
# information about sysconfig files can be found here:
# http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/SUSE_Package_Conventions/Sysconfig
# It's generally a good idea to avoid using shell variable
# substitution (foo="$bar") and multi line values.
#
# If you have any problems configuring this file, take a look at
# /usr/share/doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/EXAMPLES or use YaST
#
# For end user systems that are only connected to one network
# FW_DEV_EXT and maybe FW_CONFIGURATIONS_EXT to open some ports need
# to be modified. The defaults for all other settings are usually
# fine.
#
# For firewalls that should perform routing or masquerading between
# networks the settings FW_DEV_EXT, FW_DEV_INT, FW_ROUTE, FW_MASQUERADE,
# FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP, and maybe FW_SERVICES_ACCEPT_EXT,  FW_FORWARD,
# FW_FORWARD_MASQ
#
# Please note that if you use service names, they have to exist in
# /etc/services. There is for example no service "dns", it's called
# "domain"; email is called "smtp" etc.

## Description:	SuSEfirewall2 configuration
## Type:	string
#
# Which are the interfaces that point to the internet/untrusted
# networks?
#
# Enter all untrusted network devices here
#
# Format: space separated list of interface or configuration names
#
# The special keyword "any" means that packets arriving on interfaces not
# explicitly configured as int, ext or dmz will be considered external. Note:
# this setting only works for packets destined for the local machine. If you
# want forwarding or masquerading you still have to add the external interfaces
# individually. "any" can be mixed with other interface names.
#
# Examples: "wlan0", "ippp0 ippp1", "any dsl0"
#
# Note: alias interfaces (like eth0:1) are ignored
#
FW_DEV_EXT=""

## Type:	string
#
# Which are the interfaces that point to the internal network?
#
# Enter all trusted network interfaces here. If you are not
# connected to a trusted network (e.g. you have just a dialup) leave
# this empty.
#
# Format: space separated list of interface or configuration names
#
# Examples: "tr0", "eth0 eth1"
#
FW_DEV_INT=""

## Type:	string
#
# Which are the interfaces that point to the dmz or dialup network?
#
# Enter all the network devices here which point to the dmz/dialups.
# A "dmz" is a special, seperated network, which is only connected
# to the firewall, and should be reachable from the internet to
# provide services, e.g. WWW, Mail, etc. and hence is at risk from
# attacks. See /usr/share/doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/EXAMPLES for an
# example.
#
# Note: You have to configure FW_FORWARD to define the services
# which should be available to the internet and set FW_ROUTE to yes.
#
# Format: space separated list of interface or configuration names
#
# Examples: "tr0", "eth0 eth1"
#
FW_DEV_DMZ=""

## Type:	yesno
#
# Should routing between the internet, dmz and internal network be
# activated?
#
# Set this to "yes" if you either want to masquerade internal
# machines or allow access to the dmz (or internal machines, but
# this is not a good idea).
# 
# This option overrides IP_FORWARD from /etc/sysconfig/sysctl and
# net.ipv4.ip_forward settings in /etc/sysctl.conf
# Note: IPv4 only. The IPv6 forwarding sysctl has to be turned on
# manually.
#
# Setting this option one alone doesn't do anything. Either activate
# masquerading with FW_MASQUERADE below if you want to masquerade
# your internal network to the internet, or configure FW_FORWARD to
# define what is allowed to be forwarded. You also need to define
# internal or dmz interfaces in FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ.
#
# defaults to "no" if not set
#
FW_ROUTE="no"

## Type:	yesno
#
# Do you want to masquerade internal networks to the outside?
#
# Requires: FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ, FW_ROUTE, FW_MASQ_DEV
#
# "Masquerading" means that all your internal machines which use
# services on the internet seem to come from your firewall. Please
# note that it is more secure to communicate via proxies to the
# internet than to use masquerading.
# 
# This option is required for FW_MASQ_NETS and FW_FORWARD_MASQ.
#
# defaults to "no" if not set
#
FW_MASQUERADE="no"

## Type:	string
#
# You also have to define on which interfaces to masquerade on.
# Those are usually the same as the external interfaces. Most users
# can leave the default.
#
# The special string "zone:" concatenated with the name of a zone
# means to take all interfaces in the specified zone.
#
# Note: Old version of SuSEfirewall2 used a shell variable
# ($FW_DEV_EXT) here. That method is deprecated as it breaks auto
# detection of interfaces. Please use zone:ext instead.
#
# Examples: "ippp0", "zone:dmz"
#
# defaults to "zone:ext" if not set

#             This is also the default if you leave FW_MASQ_NETS empty.
#           - "10.0.0.0/8" allows the whole 10.0.0.0 network with

#           - "10.0.1.0/24,0/0,tcp,1024:65535 10.0.2.0/24" the
#             10.0.1.0/24 network is allowed to access unprivileged
#             ports whereas 10.0.2.0/24 is granted unrestricted
#             access.
#           - "0/0,!10.0.0.0/8" unrestricted access to the internet
#             with the exception of 10.0.0.8 which will not be
#             masqueraded.
#

# Tuning your upstream a little bit via HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket)
# for more information about HTB see http://www.lartc.org
#
# If your download collapses while you have a parallel upload,
# this parameter might be an option for you. It manages your
# upload stream and reserves bandwidth for special packets like
# TCP ACK packets or interactive SSH.
# It's a list of devices and maximum bandwidth in kbit.
# For example, the german TDSL account, provides 128kbit/s upstream
# and 768kbit/s downstream. We can only tune the upstream.
#
# Example:
# If you want to tune a 128kbit/s upstream DSL device like german TDSL set
# the following values:
# FW_HTB_TUNE_DEV="dsl0,125"
# where dsl0 is your pppoe device and 125 stands for 125kbit/s upstream
#
# you might wonder why 125kbit/s and not 128kbit/s. Well practically you'll
# get a better performance if you keep the value a few percent under your
# real maximum upload bandwidth, to prevent the DSL modem from queuing traffic in
# it's own buffers because queing is done by us now.
# So for a 256kbit upstream
#   FW_HTB_TUNE_DEV="dsl0,250"
# might be a better value than "dsl0,256". There is no perfect value for a
# special kind of modem. The perfect value depends on what kind of traffic you
# have on your line but 5% under your maximum upstream might be a good start.
# Everthing else is special fine tuning.
# If you want to know more about the technical background,
# http://tldp.org/HOWTO/ADSL-Bandwidth-Management-HOWTO/

#   traffic unless you setup your own rules.
#
# - drop: drop all IPv6 packets.
#
# - reject: reject all IPv6 packets. This is the default if stateful matching is
#   not available.
#
# Disallowing IPv6 packets may lead to long timeouts when connecting to IPv6
# Adresses. See FW_IPv6_REJECT_OUTGOING to avoid this.
