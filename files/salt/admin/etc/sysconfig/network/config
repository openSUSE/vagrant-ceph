# Note: 
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.
#
# Note: The ISC dhclient started by the NetworkManager is not using any
# of these options -- NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     yes
# If ifup should check if an IPv4 address is already in use, set this to yes.
#
# Make sure that packet sockets (CONFIG_PACKET) are supported in the kernel,
# since this feature uses arp, which depends on that.
# Also be aware that this takes one second per interface; consider that when
# setting up a lot of interfaces. 
CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP="yes"

## Type:        list(auto,yes,no)
## Default:     auto
# If ifup should send a gratuitous ARP to inform the receivers about its

#
# When using NetworkManager you may define a timeout to wait for NetworkManager

# This variable enables netconfig to always force a replace of modified
# files and automatically enables the -f | --force-replace parameter.
#
# The purpose is to use it as workaround, when some other tool trashes
# the files, e.g. /etc/resolv.conf and you observe messages like this
# in your logs on in "netconfig update" output:
# ATTENTION: You have modified /etc/resolv.conf. Leaving it untouched.

# Please do not forget to also report a bug as we have a system policy
# to use netconfig.
